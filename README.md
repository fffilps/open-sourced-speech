# OPEN SOURCE SPEECH 

Found two open source speech libraries - one for transcription (speech to text) - Moonshine.js and then speech to text (Chatterbox)

This is just a project with both libraries in it. I am currenlty building out a work flow using them both and demos. 
Both are new and not really best maintained, so this may flop, as using the backend is hard and the front end, im figuring out the nuances of it still.
